We want to build a runnable game in python. Designers already provided us some game assets, including ["player.png", "obstable.png", "zombie.png", "missile.png", "gun.png", "road.png"]. This is a game that the bacground is a road with zombies, coming from the road, the player will control a character holding a gun that automatically launch missiles every seconds to hit the zombie. The zombie will die after getting hit by the missile once. The player will move up on the road automatically with a steady speed, it's a 2D side-scrolling shooter style, player can only control go left and right using the keyboard. If player getting touched by the zombie, the player will die. The player's score is calculated by how many zombies it kills. On the road other than zombies, there are obstables, every obstables has a life point shown on it in the range of [10, 20], if a obstables getting killed by the player, the player's speed of shooting the missile will upgrade to 2X. The game is set in a desert environment at night. The game has a frantic and fast-paced atmosphere and is presented in a 2D side-scrolling shooter style. The player is positioned in the bottom of the screen. The player cannot move off the screen, and zombie cannot move, zombies and obstables appear randomly as the game progress on the top of the screen as player moves, the missile shot in straight line.

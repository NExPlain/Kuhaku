## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main game loop and initializes the game."),
    ("player.py", "Implements the Player class, including the move and shoot methods."),
    ("zombie.py", "Implements the Zombie class and its move method."),
    ("obstacle.py", "Implements the Obstacle class."),
    ("missile.py", "Implements the Missile class and its move method."),
    ("game.py", "Implements the Game class, including the update, draw, and check_collision methods, and manages the game state.")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "player.py",
    "zombie.py",
    "obstacle.py",
    "missile.py",
    "game.py",
    "main.py"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
'pygame' is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries.
'player.py', 'zombie.py', 'obstacle.py', and 'missile.py' implement the respective classes and their behaviors.
'game.py' manages the game state and handles the game logic.
'main.py' is the entry point of the game, it initializes the game and contains the main game loop.
